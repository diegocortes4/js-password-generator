Portfolio project:


In this project we will generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. To generate a password the user will be asked if would like to use upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and or symbols and this app will run in the browser generating a password matching the selected criteria.
